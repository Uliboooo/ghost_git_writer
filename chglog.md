## 0.4.0

* feat: add feat to spin a spinner during llm processing

## 0.3.6

Here's a breakdown of the changes in the provided Rust code diff:

**Key Modifications:**

*   **Argument Handling in `Readme` struct:**
    *   The `source_path_list` field in the `Readme` struct was changed from `Vec<String>` to `Option<Vec<String>>`
    *   Added logic to handle the mutually exclusive arguments `source_path_list` and `dir`

**Purpose and Impact:**

*   **Flexibility in Readme Creation:**

    *   The change in `source_path_list` to be optional enables the user to specify either a list of source files or a directory for generating a README. Previously, only a list of source files was supported.
    *   The `dir` argument allows the program to read all files in a specified directory for README generation.
    *   The `required_unless_present` and `conflicts_with` arguments ensure that either `source_path_list` or `dir` must be provided, but not both. This improves the command-line interface by making the usage cl
earer and preventing ambiguous configurations.

*   **Directory Traversal for Readme Generation:**

    *   The code now handles the case where a directory is provided as input for README generation. It reads all files within the directory and uses them as input for the README creation process.
    *   The error handling ensures that if neither `source_path_list` nor `dir` is provided, the program will return an error indicating that a file path is not set.

## 0.3.2
